# What I find Interesting

I choose one of my favorite articles by Moxie Marlinspike. He has done a lot of cool cryptography stuff (e.g. creation of Signal/Signal Protocol, Convergence, Head of Security at Twitter), and I thought that his comments on web3 would be especially interesting. I thought that his practical approach to thinking about the viability of web3 in opposition to usual idealist view that exists in many crypto circles. He also brings up the reliance on centralized servers that these theoretical distributed systems are supposed to have. 

Ultimately, he makes the argument that the privacy bar of web3 is pretty low and actually arguably lower than web2. The technology seems pretty neat, but ultimately is bringing people in because it is a new technology to get excited about. The fundamental arguments that people are not going to want to run their own servers and that the burden of creating software should be lowered instead of increased, I believe hold true.

## Jacob's Comment
The author clearly has a lack of trust in the prospects and safety of Web3 which I don't think are misplaced but I agree that if nothing else, Web3 is a fun experiment that we may not really know what to do with yet, but could lead to a new paradigm that could change many aspects of how the internet exists.

# Kevin's Comment
The article brings up good points regarding the lack of UI for new and hot technologies such as block-chain and crypto. As mentioned in the article, companies have taken advantage of this to create popular applictions where users can make transactions. Another interesting point is NFTs and how they are merly just images. It's very sifficult for a device to determine what a image is the "Correct" image, expecially when it comes to transactions for such products on the market.
